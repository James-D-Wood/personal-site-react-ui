# My Personal Site Front End

This React App is the client side for my personal web site [jameswood.dev](https://jameswood.dev/). 
Out of the box it is set up to run locally using a separate backend that can be found [here](https://github.com/James-D-Wood/personal-site-go-server) running at api.jameswood.dev.

You can build your own version local, provided you have NodeJS and npm installed on your device.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/James-D-Wood/personal-site-react-ui.git
cd personal-site-react-ui
npm install     # install dependencies
npm run build   # builds the app
npm run start   # starts the app on localhost:3000
```

You should be able to navigate to the Dev Notebook section and see articles. If so, you are connected to the API and good to go!
